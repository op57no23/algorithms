# Queues

Implementation of the Deque data structure using a linked list and the randomized queue data structure using a resizing array. All deque operations and randomized queue operations are acheived in constant time. The RandomizedQueue class also supports iteration.

The Permutation class uses the randomized queue to return a random sequence of strings from the standard input.

## How to run Permutation

- java -jar perm.jar n < inputFile.txt
	- n is an integer and the number of strings to be printed
	- inputFile.txt -- the file to be read by standard input. Strings separated by spaces
