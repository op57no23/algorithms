# Algorithms Part I (Princeton/Coursera)

This repository contains code for the 5 projects I completed for https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1. The course covers algorithmic analysis, stacks and queues, sorting algorithms, search trees, and hash tables. The projects are applications of built-in data structures and implementations of custom data structures. All code is written in Java. All code in .java files in this repository was written by me but often relies on classes from the [course's package](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/javadoc/). All projects are tested by an auto-grader for correctness and memory and runtime efficiency. 

## Projects

### Percolation

An application of the union-find data for finding connected components in an n x n grid. Estimates on average what proportion of cells must be open for a cell in the top row of the grid to be connected to a cell in the bottom row. 

### Queues

Implementation of Deque and randomized queue data structures.

### 8puzzle

Solver for an n x n generalization of the [8puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle) using priority queue and A\* algorithm

### Collinear Points

Efficiently finding line segments from list of points using sorting.

### KdTree

An implementation of the k-d tree to efficiently solve the nearest-neighbor and range search problems for points in 2d space.
